# GameEngine

Project for fun, attempting to build a 2D/3D game engine from scratch.
This project uses SDL2, see setup instructions below.

For now, I will start working slowly from here. 
I will build a small game without building the game engine.

## Setup Instructions
Please note that this project uses CLion and C++20. The target set is Visual Studio not MinGW 
 -  run `vcpkg install`

# Todo
- integrate a package manager called vcpkg
